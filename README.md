### Game Concept

In a world taken over by robot boxing there is a small robot called Atom trying to make it in the world of boxing.
On his journey to get stronger he needs to evade the stronger robots and collect as many stars as possible to get to the end of the game.

### How to play

- Jump by pressing the 'up' arrow on your keyboard.
- Collect stars in order to increase your score to become the best robot boxer.
- Avoid all obstacles to keep Atom alive.

## Game Development Stages

- **Day 1**
**Learn Phaser 3 module**
 I code along the Phaser 3 platform game tutorial learning the basics about how to structure the project. I setup as well the current repo, installing Webpack and Phaser 3, thinking about the game logic. Manage to complete this steps without any problems.

- **Day 2**
**Game Design**
 Pulish the game concept, define the characters and main objective. Look for assets to implement all of the game scenes. Define the game rules and logic. Plan the development of the game in specific chunks of user stories converted to technical tasks to be done.

  - Implement leaderboard menu

- **Day 5**
**Deployment**
  - Run tests (Done)
  - Deploy to netlify (Done)

### Retrospective:

After developing the game and looking back at the initial plan, conceived on the second day these are some reflections about my development.

What went wrong?
Overall, I assume Phaser would be easier. It's documentation is confusing and not cohesive enough. This meant a lot of time was invested in googling how to work around specific things, such as animations and implementing forms. This was not easy at all and very time consuming. The provided examples and tutorial didn't seem enough. 

What went well?
Creating the game itself went really well..
